                    <p>The shortage of conventional fossil fuels, growing emissions of combustion-generated pollutants,
                        and their skyrocketing made biomass sources an alternative solution to this energy crisis.
                        Current oil and gas reserves are going to last for just a few decades. To address this rising
                        energy demand, fuels such as Biodiesel are at the forefront of alternative technologies which
                        can act as a viable alternative for compression-ignition engines. In this present study, we have
                        carried out a series of experiments on a four-stroke single-cylinder diesel engine using a rope
                        brake dynamometer where we have used diesel and biodiesel as a working fuel. Thereafter we have
                        compared the various performance parameters between them and documented the results in graphical
                        form for easy understanding.</p>

                    <p>In the modern generation heat exchange equipment has become of great importance in many
                        industrial processes and internal combustion engines because it increases the use of energy
                        resources as well as conversion and reuse of energy. In recycling thermal energy, the
                        minimization of temperature differences is more important. High-specific output engines can be
                        developed by developing finned surfaces. Thus fins play an important role in energy. Our
                        investigation deals with the problem of finding the optimum configuration of the fin with the
                        maximum heat dissipation rate. This experimental study focuses on the analysis of the effectof
                        forced convection and natural convection on the characteristics of heat transfer within the pin
                        fin.</p>
