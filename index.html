                        We are studying the primary factors that affect fuel consumption and predicting the accurate value for such quantities would provide a correct estimation of fuel consumption for passenger cars. We have plotted various graphs of linear progression and polynomial progression by curve fitting technique using Python and Machine Learning library i.e., Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.</p>

                    <h3>Comparison of performance parameters and characteristics between diesel and biodiesel for fours stroke single cylinder diesel engine.</h3>
                    <p>7 April 2022</p>
                    <!-- <img src="project-thumbnail.png" alt="description of image"> -->
                    <p>The shortage of conventional fossil fuels, growing emissions of combustion-generated pollutants, and their skyrocketing made biomass sources an alternative solution to this energy crisis. Current oil and gas reserves are going to last for just a few decades. To address this rising energy demand, fuels such as Biodiesel are at the forefront of alternative technologies which can act as a viable alternative for compression-ignition engines. In this present study, we have carried out a series of experiments on a four-stroke single-cylinder diesel engine using a rope brake dynamometer where we have used diesel and biodiesel as a working fuel. Thereafter we have compared the various performance parameters between them and documented the results in graphical form for easy understanding.</p>

                    <p>1 February 2022</p>
                    <!-- <img src="project-thumbnail.png" alt="description of image"> -->
                    <p>In the modern generation heat exchange equipment has become of great importance in many industrial processes and internal combustion engines because it increases the use of energy resources as well as conversion and reuse of energy. In recycling thermal energy, the minimization of temperature differences is more important. High-specific output engines can be developed by developing finned surfaces. Thus fins play an important role in energy. Our investigation deals with the problem of finding the optimum configuration of the fin with the maximum heat dissipation rate. This experimental study focuses on the analysis of the effectof forced convection and natural convection on the characteristics of heat transfer within the pin fin.</p>
